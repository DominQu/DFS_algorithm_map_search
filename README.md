# DFS_algorithm_map_search
This is a student project. The task was to write a program, which would determine where can water pipes go on a map with cities. The condition was that water pipes can go only on roads. The specific path had to be chosen by the DFS algorithm.

### How the program works:

At first the user inputs map dimensions. After that the program creates a rectangular map with randomly generated roads. Than the algorithm decides where can water pipes go. The results are printed in the terminal.

### What I learned:

+ how DFS algorithm works and how to implement it
+ how to use recursion
+ how to use C++ dynamic allocation of memory
